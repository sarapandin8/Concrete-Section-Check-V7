- UI.PMM.NAV2: Flexural PMM result-view tabs (`Summary`, `PMM Check`, `3D Interaction`, `SLS`, `Diagnostics / QA`) are now rendered immediately under the Flexural (PMM) workspace after run/cache controls, before lower method QA and stored snapshot expanders; no solver or demand/capacity logic changed.
- UI.ANALYSIS.NAV1: Analysis subpage label now reads `ULS Strength`, and the Column/Pier ULS Strength Check selector is shown directly under that subpage before the decision/result panels; no solver or demand/capacity logic changed.
- UI.PMM.COMPACT1: Flexural PMM decision-first compact workspace; advanced setup, input overview, method notes, stored snapshot, and diagnostics are collapsed so the PMM visual decision review appears earlier without changing solver equations.
- UI.ACTION.BUTTONS2: highlighted action buttons now respect enabled/disabled state; Flexural PMM runtime controls use compact status cards without changing solver logic.
- UI.ACTIVE.TABS3: navigation density polish; deterministic tab clusters are tighter, working-screen vertical spacing is reduced, and active-tab highlight is lighter while preserving existing tab positions and options.
- UI.ACTIVE.TABS2: compact commercial active tab bar; deterministic app-owned navigation now stays left-aligned and detail `st.tabs` use dark-blue active styling.
# Concrete Section Pro

- UI.PMM.NAV3: Move PMM result-view tabs immediately under Flexural (PMM); run/cache and diagnostics remain below.

## Current Baseline Note — UI.COMMERCIAL.TABS4

This repository has advanced beyond the older README milestone history below. `APP.BRAND1` renames the visible application/report brand to **Concrete Section Pro** and relaxes compact-header CSS so the product title no longer clips at the top of the working screen. The current uploaded baseline is `Concrete-Section-Check-V6`, stabilized by `QA.BASELINE1`, `WORKFLOW.STATUS1`, `STATUS.COLPIER1`, `STATUS.COLPIER2`, `STATE.SECTION1`, `STATE.RESULT1`, `STATE.RESULT2`, `STATE.RESULT3`, and `STATE.RESULT4`; subsequent section geometry milestones and `QA.CODE.AUDIT1` add filleted/chamfered hollow section benchmarks plus a Streamlit duplicate download-key hotfix. `UI.KEYS1` hardens all app/UI `st.button()` and `st.download_button()` call sites with explicit unique keys to reduce duplicate-element regressions. `UI.COMMERCIAL.TABS4` adds a clear dark-blue active-tab highlight for the existing navigation controls. `UI.COMMERCIAL.SECTION1` added a commercial-style Section Builder header, panel titles, and preview-canvas polish without changing solver, geometry, or project schema behavior. The current architecture includes Column/Pier/Wall/Pylon flexural PMM production-preview readiness evidence, ACI RC nonprestressed Column/Pier shear/torsion/V+T scoped PASS/FAIL gates, guarded Beam/Girder ULS flexure/shear/torsion preview routing, staged Beam/Girder SLS stress workflows, SLS deflection/camber preview, validation packs, and Word report QA. `UI.COMMERCIAL.TABS1` removes the extra nested Section Builder workflow bar and applies visual-only commercial styling to existing app tabs without navigation changes. `UI.COMMERCIAL.TABS2` strengthens existing tab, button, and user-input label typography with bold dark-blue text and slightly larger tab/button sizing without adding or moving controls. `UI.COMMERCIAL.TABS3` broadens the selector coverage to the current Streamlit `stButtonGroup` DOM used by the visible segmented navigation, so the Workspace and subpage tabs actually receive the commercial typography. `UI.ACTIVE.TABS1` replaces fragile selected-state CSS with deterministic app-owned active-tab rendering, `UI.ACTIVE.TABS2` makes the tab cluster compact and left-aligned, and `UI.ACTIVE.TABS3` further tightens the navigation density and working-screen vertical spacing. `UI.PMM.COMPACT1` makes the Flexural (PMM) workspace decision-first by collapsing setup/readiness/input overview/method notes/stored snapshots behind expanders and moving PMM Visual Review ahead of detailed cache/trace outputs.

`QA.BASELINE1` does not change solver equations, PMM demand/capacity logic, prestress `Pe_eff` behavior, shear/torsion formulas, service-stress formulas, deflection formulas, or report calculation logic. It only aligns stale tests/docs and adds a pytest-only Streamlit fallback for environments without the UI runtime installed.

Column/Pier ACI RC nonprestressed shear, torsion, and V+T detail tabs now align with the ULS Decision Summary and can issue scoped `PASS`/`FAIL` when the implemented gates are complete. `STATUS.COLPIER2` fixes the Streamlit render-order issue where the visually top decision summary could read stale PMM demand/capacity state and show `NOT READY` on the same rerun that successfully calculated Flexural (PMM). AASHTO LRFD, active prestress in V/T, seismic special detailing, anchorage/hooks, lap splices, shop-drawing detailing, and final code-certified project claims remain explicitly guarded. `STATE.SECTION1` fixes Section Builder widget-state restoration after inactive workspaces are skipped: user-edited geometry and composite metadata now restore from durable `section_parameters` instead of resetting to preset defaults when returning from Setup/Loads/Analysis. `STATE.RESULT1` persists valid Flexural (PMM) result cache and D/C summary metadata in saved project JSON, restores them only when their engineering input hash still matches the loaded project, and clarifies that normal Streamlit page rerenders are not solver reruns. `STATE.RESULT2` added PMM display-artifact caching and an explicit detailed-dashboard render gate. `STATE.RESULT3` restores the main PMM Visual Review, PMM Check, and 3D Interaction tabs so the PMM/3D graphics remain discoverable after a successful run; only legacy raw point-cloud plots and raw PMM tables remain behind an advanced rendering toggle. `STATE.RESULT4` hotfixes the duplicate Streamlit download-button element ID caused when the stored result snapshot and dashboard Summary tab both render the ULS D/C trace CSV export in one rerun. `SECTION.PROPERTY.BENCHMARK1` adds executable section-property benchmarks for the filleted/chamfered hollow presets, including closed-form rectangular hollow zero-feature checks, analytical area checks, and centroid-direction sanity checks.

### WORKFLOW.STATUS1 — Workflow Capability Wording Alignment

The clean repo baseline now aligns Setup, Analysis, Project Design Code capability guards, and draft report wording with the current implemented Beam/Girder guarded preview capabilities. Bridge/Building Beam-Girder flexure, SHEAR.CODE2, TORSION.CODE2, combined V+T, staged SLS stress, deflection/camber, prestress, and debonding tools are described as preview / engineering-review workflows only. Column/Pier AASHTO PMM remains planned / REVIEW, and final code-certified girder design remains outside current scope.

See `docs/design/qa_baseline1.md`, `docs/design/workflow_status1.md`, `docs/design/status_colpier1.md`, `docs/design/status_colpier2.md`, `docs/design/state_section1.md`, `docs/design/state_result1.md`, `docs/design/state_result2.md`, `docs/design/state_result3.md`, `docs/design/state_result4.md`, and `docs/design/section_property_benchmark1.md`, and `docs/design/ui_keys1.md`, `docs/design/ui_commercial_section1.md` for milestone scope and QA gate notes.


## Milestone QA.PO1 Scope

- Adds an executable prestress-aware axial cap validation pack.
- Checks RC-only, PS-only, and RC + bonded prestress nominal `Po` against independent formulas.
- Confirms `Po` subtracts `Ast` and `Aps` once from concrete compression and adds `fy*Ast` plus `fpy*Aps` or `0.90fpu*Aps`.
- Confirms `Pe_eff` and product breaking-load metadata are not used in nominal axial strength.
- Confirms prestress `count` multiplies element area once and unbonded prestress is excluded upstream before the axial-cap helper is called.
- Confirms tied-column `phiPn,max` cap uses `0.80 * phi * Po`.
- Existing PMM solver, D/C extraction, prestress stress model, warning display, load import, and report export behavior are unchanged.

# Concrete PMM Pro

Professional Streamlit engineering application foundation for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete PMM analysis.

This repository is at Milestone PS.DB1.2 plus P.1.1, V.PS1.1 visualization cleanup, and R.FIG.1.1 figure-export deployment hotfix. The PMM solver and ULS demand/capacity workflow are still prototypes. The app navigation is grouped into engineering workspaces, and the Analysis workspace has real subtabs for ULS Strength, SLS / Stress & Cracking, and Report / QA. Analysis now includes runtime controls, stable engineering-input hashes, cache status indicators, and lightweight timing diagnostics around expensive UI-triggered operations. Existing Project, Materials, Section Builder, Rebar, Prestress, Loads, PMM, SLS, cracking, report export, and report QA tools remain reachable without changing calculation logic. Bonded prestress contribution is included in the PMM prototype with refined prestressing steel stress-strain models, ordinary rebar displaced-concrete refinement, independent hand-calculation spot checks, engineering verification safeguards, benchmark-style solver checks, refined PMM slice interpolation, slice envelope robustness checks, clearer warning/reporting text, numerical cleanup, elastic SLS stress checks using either gross or uncracked transformed section properties, optional effective bonded prestress contribution, no-tension/decompression serviceability judgement, SLS stress sign benchmark checks, cracking/tension-zone classification from existing SLS stress results, custom SLS stress check points with geometry validation, SLS stress visualization on the section, context-aware engineering limitation filtering, report manifest JSON, draft Word report export, and Word report QA; unbonded prestress, full cracked-section stress redistribution, crack-width checks, Beam/Girder flexure/shear/torsion checks, PDF export, and production-grade design certification are intentionally not implemented yet.



## Current Validation Direction

Latest validation milestones add a traceable path from prototype PMM results toward commercial-grade engineering QA:

- `QA.VALIDATION1` establishes the validation matrix and report runner.
- `VALID.RC1` adds rectangular RC axial/bending/symmetry benchmark checks.
- `VALID.RC2` adds ACI-style phi transition and tension-control benchmark checks.
- `VALID.PS1` adds bonded-prestress PS-only and RC+PS benchmark checks for `eps_t`, `Pe_eff/fpe`, `Po + Aps`, stress-warning metadata, and RC+PS numeric schema.
- `VALID.PS2` adds prestress stress-state governing-region checks so fpu-cap and compression-reversal warnings can be classified as governing-related or background PMM-surface events.
- `SOLVER.PS.PASSIVE1` separates Pe_eff=0/fpe=0 passive PT bars/strands from active prestress, so passive high-strength steel contributes to PMM strength without active-prestress fpu-cap or compression-reversal warnings.
- `SOLVER.PS.STRESS1` treats active-prestress fpu-cap events as PMM stress-state metadata rather than standalone global warnings, with escalation reserved for governing-region impact.

These validation packs do not hide solver warnings.  They provide the evidence needed to later downgrade prototype wording into documented method notes or keep true governing-impact warnings visible.


## Milestone SOLVER.PS.STRESS1 Scope

- Keeps active-prestress fpu-cap events in PMM point metadata for QA and governing-region checks.
- Stops promoting background fpu-cap events from ultimate PMM surface generation into standalone engineering warnings.
- Keeps active-prestress compression-reversal and fallback warnings as engineering-review items.
- Updates warning guidance so fpu-cap events are usually QA/numerical notes unless governing-impact classification escalates them.
- Does not change PMM force equilibrium, material stress calculation, D/C equations, load import, report export, or prestress input behavior.

## Milestone SOLVER.PS.PASSIVE1 Scope

- Separates passive prestressing-steel rows from active prestress rows.
- Treats rows with Pe_eff/fpe/initial strain equal to zero as bonded high-strength passive steel.
- Keeps passive PS bars/strands in strain compatibility and phi eps_t tracking.
- Prevents passive rows from emitting active-prestress compression-reversal or fpu-cap warnings.
- Adds passive-PS benchmark checks and regression tests.
- Does not remove active-prestress warnings for rows with nonzero Pe_eff/fpe/initial strain.

## Milestone VALID.PS2 Scope

- Adds prestress stress-state governing-region benchmark pack.
- Adds per-PMM-point compression-reversal metadata alongside existing fpu-cap metadata.
- Checks that fpu-cap events can be separated into global PMM-surface events and events near the governing Pu region.
- Checks that compression-reversal events are traceable by PMM region for later warning-policy refinement.
- Does not change PMM solver equations, D/C equations, load import, report export, or prestress input behavior.

## Milestone VALID.RC2 Scope

- Adds RC phi transition / tension-control benchmark pack.
- Directly checks tied-column ACI-style phi behavior for compression-controlled, transition, tension-controlled, and no-tensile-strain cases.
- Verifies the rectangular RC PMM sweep samples all phi regions.
- Verifies every RC PMM point phi value and strain-condition label matches the independent phi helper.
- Does not change solver equations, PMM D/C logic, prestress behavior, load import, report export, or UI warning display.

## Milestone QA.VALIDATION1 Scope

- Added a formal PMM solver validation framework instead of relying on UI warning cleanup.
- Added `concrete_pmm_pro/verification/validation_framework.py` with a validation matrix covering RC-only PMM, prestress PMM, demand/capacity interpolation, numerical robustness, and warning policy.
- Added validation tests that confirm solver warning families are tied to root-cause validation items rather than being hidden from the user.
- Added `docs/validation/pmm_solver_validation.md` to document the path from prototype warnings toward benchmark-supported commercial-grade behavior.
- Existing PMM solver equations, D/C logic, prestress stress model, load import, report export, and UI result values are unchanged.

## Internal Units

- Length: mm
- Stress: MPa
- Force: N
- Moment: N-mm

## Milestone PS.DB1 Scope

- Added an explicit 15.2 mm strand tendon product database for standard products including `6-1`, `6-7`, `6-12`, `6-19`, and `6-55`.
- Tendon product records include strand count, strand diameter, strand steel area, tendon steel area, nominal breaking load, fpu, duct type, duct ID reference, and typical use where available.
- Added custom tendon generation by strand count, such as `6-25`, using default 15.2 mm strands, 140 mm2 per strand, 1860 MPa fpu, and 260 kN breaking load per strand.
- The Prestress tab can append standard or custom tendon products to the manual table while preserving existing manual/custom prestress entry behavior.
- Product selection sets `Area_mm2` to total tendon steel area, leaves `Diameter_mm` blank for tendon groups, and keeps effective prestress `Pe_eff_kN` / `fpe_MPa` user-controlled.
- Breaking load and duct information are shown as reference metadata only and are not treated as effective prestress or steel diameter.
- Section preview remains V.PS1.1 true-scale circular steel area based on tendon steel area, not duct diameter.
- Section Builder geometry parameters remain inside Sections -> Section Builder, not in `st.sidebar`.
- Existing PMM/SLS solver formulas, prestress sign convention, D/C algorithm, runtime cache logic, report export, report QA, and engineering limitations are unchanged.

## Milestone PS.DB1.1 Scope

- Simplified tendon product creation to two modes: Standard tendon product and Custom tendon.
- Manual prestress editing remains available in the Advanced Prestress Table instead of as a separate product creation mode.
- Product dropdown options include standard tendon products, prestress database products, and custom labels already present in the current table.
- Project save/load preserves or safely reconstructs tendon product metadata such as strand count, breaking-load reference, duct type, and duct ID.
- Product breaking load remains reference-only, `Count` remains the number of identical tendon elements, and `Strand Count` remains product metadata.

## Milestone PS.DB1.2 Scope

- Standard and custom 15.2 mm tendon products now populate `fpy_MPa = 1580`, `fpu_MPa = 1860`, and `Ep_MPa = 195000`.
- Tendon group `Diameter_mm` is normalized to blank/null because tendon groups are governed by total steel area, not a single steel diameter.
- Added display-only `Eq Steel Dia_mm` based on `sqrt(4A/pi)` for tendon group preview/readability; it is not stored as engineering diameter.
- Project save/load reconstructs missing tendon material defaults for clear 15.2 mm tendon group rows without inventing duct data.
- Duct ID remains reference-only and is not used as steel diameter or true-scale display diameter.

## Milestone V.PS1.1 Scope

- Section preview prestress, PT bar, and tendon group steel areas are drawn as Plotly circle shapes in section coordinate units.
- True-scale circle bounds use `x0/x1/y0/y1` from element coordinates and radius = display steel diameter / 2.
- Display steel diameter uses nominal steel diameter for single strand/PT bar when available, or equivalent steel-area diameter from `sqrt(4A/pi)`.
- Tendon group display diameter uses total steel area equivalent diameter and does not use duct or pipe diameter.
- Small circular scatter markers remain only for hover text and legend entries.
- Existing PMM/SLS solver formulas, prestress sign convention, D/C algorithm, material models, load interpretation, report export, report QA, and engineering limitations are unchanged.

## Milestone V.PS1 Scope

- Section preview prestress markers now use circular markers for strand, tendon, wire, PT bar, and custom prestress steel.
- Rebar remains circular and keeps its existing visual style.
- Prestressing strand/tendon and PT bars are distinguished by color and legend group instead of marker shape.
- Prestress marker sizing is based on nominal steel diameter when available for single steel elements, or equivalent steel-area diameter when diameter is unavailable.
- Tendon group preview diameter is based on total steel area equivalent diameter, not a duct or pipe diameter.
- Hover text shows true nominal diameter, display steel diameter, display basis, per-element steel area, total steel area, Pe_eff, and bonded status.
- Existing PMM/SLS solver formulas, prestress sign convention, D/C algorithm, material models, load interpretation, report export, report QA, and engineering limitations are unchanged.

## Milestone P.1.1 Scope

- Demand/capacity summary caching now uses a dedicated D/C input hash instead of reusing only the PMM result hash.
- The D/C hash combines the PMM result/input hash with active ULS demand case data used by the prototype D/C check.
- D/C cache reuse is invalidated when active ULS `Pu`, `Mux`, `Muy`, load activity, or the PMM result hash changes.
- UI-only load-case notes remain excluded from the D/C cache hash.
- Existing session-state cache keys are preserved where possible while also storing the dedicated D/C input hash.
- Existing PMM/SLS solver formulas, prestress sign convention, D/C algorithm, material models, load interpretation, report export, report QA, and engineering limitations are unchanged.

## Milestone R.FIG.1.1 Scope

- Plotly is constrained to `plotly>=5.22,<6` and Kaleido is pinned to `kaleido==0.2.1` for deployment-friendly Plotly PNG export compatibility with Plotly 5.x environments.
- Draft Word reports continue to embed export-ready Plotly figures as PNG images when local static image export succeeds.
- If PNG export fails, the Word report still generates with the existing figure placeholder and Kaleido/detail warning.
- HTML export fallback remains available.
- Report export still uses stored results and does not rerun solvers.
- Existing PMM/SLS solver formulas, sign conventions, D/C logic, report QA, warning propagation, and engineering limitations are unchanged.

## Milestone P.1 Scope

- ULS Strength includes an `Analysis Runtime Control` panel with Fast, Standard, and High Accuracy presets.
- Fast, Standard, and High Accuracy wire to existing neutral-axis angle/depth resolution controls; Standard matches the previous default resolution.
- PMM analysis uses a stable engineering-input hash and reuses cached PMM results when the hash is unchanged.
- Hash inputs include section geometry, holes, materials, rebar, prestress/PT bar data, bonded/unbonded flags, effective prestress values, load cases, relevant analysis settings, and the selected accuracy preset.
- Hash inputs intentionally exclude UI-only notes, labels, generated prestress ids, section metadata, selected tabs, report preview options, and plot display state.
- D/C summaries are cached against the PMM result hash to avoid silent recomputation on UI reruns.
- SLS stress checks store a serviceability input hash and can reuse cached SLS results when serviceability inputs are unchanged.

- Existing PMM/SLS calculations are unchanged.
- Report export remains future work.

- Analysis Mode / Member Type framework adds Column / Pier / Wall / Pylon PMM Mode, Beam / Girder Future Mode, and General Section Mode.
- Column / Pier / Wall / Pylon PMM Mode is the current primary workflow and continues to use `Pu`, `Mux`, and `Muy` with PMM interaction, ULS D/C review, and SLS stress tools.
- Beam / Girder Mode is a placeholder for future flexure, shear, torsion, transfer-stage, service-stage, and tendon-profile workflows. Beam/Girder calculations are not implemented yet.
- General Section Mode keeps the existing PMM and SLS tools available for section review when the member type is not yet classified.
- Existing PMM solver behavior, existing SLS stress formulas, and existing LoadCase `Pu` / `Mux` / `Muy` fields are unchanged.
- Prestress should not be double-counted by entering effective prestress `Pe` as `Pu` demand when prestress elements are already defined.

- Active SLS load cases are filtered and displayed in engineering units using `Pu`, `Mux`, and `Muy`.
- Gross section properties are calculated from `SectionGeometry` using net concrete area for hollow sections: area, centroid, `Ix`, `Iy`, `Ixy`, bounds, and section moduli.
- Default serviceability stress check points are generated at the top fiber, bottom fiber, left fiber, right fiber, and centroid.
- Elastic SLS stress checks calculate concrete stress at default stress check points for active SLS load cases using the selected section basis.
- SLS stress display uses compression negative and tension positive, intentionally separate from the ULS PMM compression-positive force convention.
- Concrete compression and tension limit checks support compression limit ratio, user-defined tension limit, `sqrt(f'c)` ratio mode, no-tension checks, and decompression checks.
- Milestone 4.5 decompression check is implemented as a no-tension stress check at selected concrete stress points; member-level tendon-zone decompression and cracked-section analysis are future work.
- SLS stress result tables report stress type, limit, utilization, PASS/FAIL status, message, and section basis.
- SLS summaries identify overall status, governing combo, governing point, maximum compression/tension stress, maximum utilization, no-tension violations, decompression violations, compression failures, and tension failures.
- Critical point filtering supports checking all default points or extreme fibers only.
- SLS Verification / Stress Sign Benchmarks run deterministic checks for axial compression sign, Mux/Muy bending signs, eccentric prestress signs, transformed-section stress behavior, no-tension/decompression judgement, and governing SLS result selection.
- SLS verification results can be exported as `sls_verification_results.csv`.
- Cracking / tension-zone classification uses existing elastic SLS stress results to identify compression, zero stress, tension within limit, tension limit exceedance, no-tension violation, and decompression violation.
- Crack classification summaries report overall classification, governing combo, governing point, maximum tension stress, and tension point count.
- Critical point filtering is respected by the crack classification workflow; `extreme_fibers_only` excludes centroid/reference points from governing classification.

- Selected combo visualization data can be exported as `sls_stress_visualization_selected_combo.csv`.
- SLS stress visualization is based on selected stress check points, not a full stress contour.
- Effective bonded prestress can be included in elastic SLS stress using existing `Pe_eff`, initial stress, or initial strain values from `PrestressElement`.
- Elastic SLS stress output reports section basis, external stress, prestress stress, and total stress separately; status and utilization use total stress.
- Prestress effective force is treated as compression on the concrete/member, with eccentricity moments from tendon location relative to the selected section-basis centroid.
- SLS prestress eccentric moment signs follow `Mpe_x = -sum(Pe * (y_ps - cy))` and `Mpe_y = -sum(Pe * (x_ps - cx))`, so a tendon located near a fiber increases compression at that same fiber.
- Unbonded prestress is ignored in SLS stress checks with a clear warning.
- Prestress losses, secondary effects, tendon profile variation along the member length, cracking, and crack widths are not calculated in the SLS check.
- Prestress service contribution summary and CSV export report bonded count, ignored unbonded count, total `Pe_eff`, prestress centroid, and `Mpe_x` / `Mpe_y`.

- Uncracked transformed section properties are available for concrete + ordinary rebar + bonded prestress using the `net_steel` transformed area convention.
- Ordinary rebar transformed contribution uses `(n_s - 1) * As`; bonded prestress contribution uses `(n_p - 1) * Aps`.

- Cracked section analysis, crack-width checks, and unbonded prestress serviceability modeling are future work.
- Rebar tab foundation with manual coordinate input.
- Rebar database in `data/rebar_database.csv`.
- Rebar validation against the current `SectionGeometry`, including outside-concrete and inside-void checks.
- Rebar summary with active bar count and total `As`.

- Prestress tab foundation with manual input for wire, strand, prestressing bar/PT bar, tendon group, and custom prestress steel.
- Prestress input modes: Passive, Effective Force Pe, Effective Stress fpe, and Jacking Stress + Losses.
- `Pe_eff_kN` is the user-facing prestress force input for Effective Force Pe mode.
- Internal prestress force remains stored as `pe_eff_n` in N.

- PT Bar / Prestressing Bar material properties include `fpu`, optional `fpy`, `Ep`, area, diameter, grade, source, and catalog verification metadata.
- `aci_beta1(fc_MPa)` helper is available for future ACI 318 workflows.
- Analysis settings are captured for the future PMM workflow, including code, strength load type, inclusion flags, phi-factor flag, and neutral-axis step counts.
- Analysis readiness / preflight checks validate that section geometry, concrete material, ULS load cases, rebars, prestress elements, and material lists are ready enough for future analysis.
- `AnalysisInput` is the intended future PMM solver input container. Future solver code should consume `AnalysisInput`, not direct Streamlit session data.
- PMM Solver Prototype generates a nominal and phi-reduced PMM point cloud from concrete, ordinary reinforcing bars, and optional bonded prestress.
- The solver consumes `AnalysisInput`; it does not read Streamlit `session_state`.
- Concrete compression uses a Whitney stress block with Shapely polygon clipping for arbitrary section geometry.
- Ordinary rebar uses linear strain compatibility with elastic-perfectly-plastic stress capped at `fy`.
- Ordinary rebar inside the Whitney compression block can use net replacement force `As(fs - 0.85f'c)` to avoid double counting concrete compression already included in the stress block.
- Ordinary rebar outside the compression block remains `As*fs`.
- Analysis Settings includes a toggle, `Subtract displaced concrete at rebar locations`, which is enabled by default and preserved in Project JSON.
- PMM results include rebar displaced-concrete subtraction and inside-compression-block counts for engineering review.
- Prestressing steel / PT Bar displaced concrete subtraction is not included yet; this refinement applies to ordinary rebar only.
- Bonded prestress contribution prototype supports wire, strand, prestressing bar/PT Bar, tendon group, and custom `PrestressElement` through the same common interface.
- Bonded prestress uses stored `initial_strain`, or converts `initial_stress_mpa` / `pe_eff_n` to initial strain when needed.
- Prototype prestress stress uses `eps_ps,total = eps_pe - eps_section`, where positive section compression reduces tendon tensile strain and section tension increases tendon tensile strain.
- Prestress stress models are selectable in Analysis settings: `bilinear` and `linear_cap`.
- `linear_cap` uses elastic `Ep * eps` stress capped between zero and `fpu`.
- `bilinear` uses `fpy` / proof stress when available, then a prototype post-yield slope before capping at `fpu`.
- If `fpy` / proof stress is missing for the bilinear model, the solver falls back to the linear capped prestress model with a clear warning.
- PT Bar / `prestressing_bar` inputs warn when `fpy_MPa` / proof stress is missing, close to `fpu_MPa`, or lower than initial prestress stress.

- Report export and advanced serviceability checks remain future milestones.
- Analysis settings include tied or spiral transverse reinforcement for prototype phi-factor and axial-cap behavior.
- RC PMM axial strength cap refinement adds ACI-style tied and spiral cap factors.

- Spiral columns use maximum axial cap factor 0.85 with compression-controlled phi of 0.75; code-specific project review remains required.
- PMM results include capped `phiPn` values for axial compression display and axial-only checks.
- RC PMM visualization displays engineering-unit summaries in kN and kN-m.

- D/C ratio is reported as demand moment magnitude divided by estimated phi-reduced directional moment capacity.
- Results include PASS, FAIL, OUT_OF_RANGE, or NOT_CHECKED status plus governing combo and maximum D/C ratio.
- Axial-only ULS D/C checks use capped maximum axial capacity when available.
- Directional moment D/C now uses a cleaned selected-Pu slice envelope with ray-intersection capacity extraction as the preferred path; point-cloud interpolation remains only as a fallback when slice/envelope data are unavailable.
- PMM Slice Dashboard adds an active ULS load case selector for reviewing a Mux-Muy capacity slice at the selected Pu.
- The dashboard shows the selected demand point, demand vector, and load case D/C status on the Mux-Muy slice.
- A 3D PMM interaction dashboard displays the PMM point cloud, active ULS load points, selected load point, and current Pu slice.
- PMM Summary Card reports selected combo, Pu, Mux, Muy, resultant Mu, available phiMn at Pu, status, D/C ratio, analysis mode, and prestress inclusion state.
- Load case D/C ranking sorts governing demand cases for engineering review.
- PMM slice visualization is based on the current prototype PMM point-cloud interpolation; final production interpolation and validation remain future work.
- PMM verification / benchmark suite builds rectangular RC benchmark cases directly as `AnalysisInput` objects.
- Benchmark cases include base RC, higher `f'c`, higher `As`, RC + bonded PT Bar, and matching RC-only cases.
- Verification checks confirm finite PMM results, positive axial capacity, higher `f'c` capacity increase, higher `As` non-reduction, and symmetric positive/negative bending balance.

- Hand check results can be displayed and exported to CSV from the Analysis tab verification expander.
- Hand checks are simplified spot checks and do not replace full independent validation or code-certified design software.
- RC-only versus RC + bonded PT Bar benchmark comparison confirms bonded prestress changes the PMM result and produces nonzero prestress force.
- Unbonded prestress ignore behavior is checked to preserve current solver scope.
- Analysis tab includes a compact `PMM Verification / Benchmark Checks` expander with PASS / WARNING / FAIL results.
- Verification suite results support engineering review but do not replace independent validation or final design certification.
- Refined PMM slice interpolation builds selected-Pu Mux-Muy slices by interpolating along each neutral-axis `theta_rad` / `c_mm` PMM point family.
- The previous tolerance-based `pmm_slice_at_pu_tolerance()` method remains available as a fallback when interpolation data is missing or too sparse.
- Preferred `pmm_slice_at_pu()` now attempts `pmm_slice_at_pu_interpolated()` first and records slice method, skipped theta count, interpolated theta count, and warnings in dataframe attrs.
- Directional ULS D/C now first builds an interpolated PMM slice at demand `Pu`; directional capacity is then read from the cleaned slice envelope with ray-intersection before fallback methods are considered.
- PMM dashboard slice plots display whether the selected Pu slice is interpolated or a tolerance fallback.
- PMM Summary Card includes slice method and D/C method so users can see how the prototype value was obtained.

- Convex hull fallback is available for visualization safety and always warns that it may overestimate non-convex interaction shapes.
- Directional ULS D/C now prefers the cleaned PMM slice envelope with ray-intersection capacity extraction, then falls back to polar slice interpolation and point-cloud directional methods only when needed.

- Neutral-axis depth sweep now uses a relative lower bound, `c_min = max(1 mm, 0.001 * projected depth)`, for improved numerical robustness.
- PMM result numerical summaries use vectorized NaN/Inf checks instead of flattening all numeric values into Python lists.

- Code-quality cleanup keeps slice duplicate checks readable and avoids repeated lazy imports inside active load-case loops.
- Standardized prototype warning constants centralize PMM prototype, D/C prototype, bonded prestress, unbonded prestress, serviceability, report export, convex hull fallback, and RC axial cap limitation wording.

## Prestressing Steel Database

`data/prestress_steel_database.csv` is the single prestressing steel database. It includes strand rows and generated high-strength prestressing bar rows with metadata columns:

- `source`
- `area_source`
- `is_catalog_verified`

Prestressing bar areas are initially generated from `pi*d^2/4`. Manufacturer catalog values should override generated areas when available.

## Run

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Test

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

## Architecture Notes

The Section Builder does not hard-code parameter inputs per section type. It reads category, preset, and parameter definitions from `data/section_presets.json` and generates controls dynamically.

All section presets are converted to `SectionGeometry` before future analysis. Future PMM solver code should consume `SectionGeometry` or `SectionModel` only, not preset names or UI metadata.

Load cases are stored in internal units before analysis. `Pu_N`, `Mux_Nmm`, and `Muy_Nmm` are the primary names for new data. Older project JSON using `Mx_Nmm` / `My_Nmm` is migrated on load.

Rebars are stored as `Rebar` objects in `st.session_state["rebars"]`. They are previewed on the current section geometry and used by the PMM prototype when included in analysis settings.

Prestress elements are stored as `PrestressElement` objects in `st.session_state["prestress_elements"]`. `Pe_eff_kN` from the UI is converted to internal `pe_eff_n`, and initial strain is stored for PMM analysis. Bonded prestress is included by the current PMM prototype when `include_prestress = True`; unbonded prestress is ignored with warning because its separate model is future work.

Project files are serialized through `ProjectModel` as JSON. Save/load is intended to preserve the current data foundation for later analysis milestones, including `analysis_settings` and `serviceability_settings`; it does not automatically trigger capacity or serviceability stress calculation.

Analysis mode settings are stored as `AnalysisModeSettings` and persisted in Project JSON. The Analysis tab can identify the current workflow as Column / Pier / Wall / Pylon PMM Mode, Beam / Girder Future Mode, or General Section Mode. Column/Pier mode keeps the existing PMM interaction workflow as the primary path. Beam/Girder mode is only a placeholder and warns that future flexure, shear, torsion, transfer-stage, service-stage, and tendon-profile checks are not implemented yet. General Section mode keeps PMM and SLS tools available for careful section-level review. The helper module `concrete_pmm_pro/core/analysis_modes.py` centralizes labels, descriptions, workflow flags, and warnings, including the reminder not to double-count prestress as `Pu`.

Pre-report QA helpers live in `concrete_pmm_pro/reporting/`. Milestone A.3 adds result traceability snapshots, report readiness checks, engineering warning consolidation, standard terminology, unit convention tables, and an available figure registry foundation. Milestone A.3.1 adds `reporting/limitations.py`, an engineering limitations registry covering `Ixy` coupling, directional D/C interpolation, convex hull fallback, neutral-axis sweep resolution, cracked-section future work, prestress axial cap method note, prestress compression reversal, unbonded prestress, crack width future work, beam/girder future checks, lightweight concrete Ec, and ultimate concrete strain code-basis review. Milestone A.3.2 fixes filtered limitations so HIGH and CRITICAL items remain visible when `include_all=False`, and narrows defensive Shapely exception handling without changing geometry behavior. Milestone A.3.2.1 adds branch coverage for Beam/Girder filtering and clarifies filtered MEDIUM limitation rules. Milestone A.3.2.2 adds coverage for alternate D/C context keys, cracking context through `crack_classification_summary`, and defensive truthiness handling that does not infer context when `bool(value)` raises. Milestone 5.0 adds report foundation files for metadata, section planning, table registry, figure registry, manifest JSON, and draft outline generation. Milestone 5.1 adds report figure export preparation through `ReportFigureContext`, `ReportFigureExportItem`, safe filenames, Plotly HTML export, optional `kaleido` PNG export, and export-ready SLS figure reconstruction from existing session results. Milestone 5.2 removes the duplicate SLS bar-chart export path, improves PMM figure context/readiness, and enables PMM Mux-Muy slice and slice-envelope export when stored dashboard dataframes already exist. Milestone 5.3 adds draft Word report export using `ReportManifest`, with metadata, traceability, readiness, warnings, limitations, units, terminology, tables, and export-ready figures when PNG export is available. Milestone 5.4 polishes the Word report with improved cover/executive summary styling, high/critical limitation emphasis, warning presentation, table truncation policy, figure captions/placeholders, report generation notes, and `ReportExportOptions`. Milestone 5.5 adds `reporting/report_qa.py` for Word report QA, including heading, disclaimer, limitation, warning, unit, terminology, traceability, figure/table, and misleading-certification wording checks. The Analysis tab can export CSV files for `result_traceability_snapshot.csv`, `report_readiness.csv`, `engineering_warnings.csv`, `engineering_limitations.csv`, `unit_conventions.csv`, `standard_terminology.csv`, `available_report_figures.csv`, `report_section_plan.csv`, `report_tables.csv`, `report_figures.csv`, `report_figure_export_registry.csv`, and `word_report_qa.csv`, plus `report_manifest.json`, `draft_report_outline.txt`, and `concrete_pmm_pro_draft_report.docx`. These helpers summarize existing session results only; they do not recalculate PMM/SLS results and do not generate PDF reports yet.

Materials are stored as `ConcreteMaterial`, `RebarMaterial`, and `PrestressSteelMaterial` objects. Project JSON preserves the active concrete material, rebar material list, prestressing steel material list, and active material names. PT Bar / Prestressing Bar elements are supported through `PrestressElement`; effective prestress force is defined in the Prestress tab.

Analysis settings are stored as `AnalysisSettings`, including tied/spiral transverse reinforcement and the `include_prestress` flag. Preflight builds an `AnalysisInput` object only when readiness errors are resolved. The Analysis tab can run the RC-only prototype or the RC + bonded prestress prototype, show point-cloud plots, export CSV results, run a prototype ULS demand/capacity check, review selected ULS cases in the PMM Slice Dashboard, and run benchmark-style verification checks.

Serviceability settings are stored as `ServiceabilitySettings`. The Analysis tab includes a `Serviceability / SLS Foundation` expander that prepares active SLS load tables, gross section properties, transformed section properties, default/custom stress check points, and elastic SLS stress checks. Milestone A.2 persists custom SLS stress check points through Project JSON, including inactive rows and non-governing flags, and restores them into the editable table after project load. The SLS display convention is compression negative and tension positive. Users can select gross section basis or uncracked transformed section basis; transformed stress uses the selected basis area, centroid, `Ix`, and `Iy`. Effective prestress is treated as compressive action on concrete. When enabled, effective bonded prestress contributes elastic SLS stress using the same selected section-basis centroid and inertia plus existing `Pe_eff`, initial stress, or initial strain from the Prestress tab; losses are not recalculated in the SLS check. Eccentric prestress induces equivalent service moments `Mpe_x = -sum(Pe * (y_ps - cy_basis))` and `Mpe_y = -sum(Pe * (x_ps - cx_basis))`, which means a tendon located near a fiber increases compression at that same fiber. No-tension and decompression checks fail when tensile stress is greater than the selected zero-stress tolerance. Decompression in Milestone 4.5 is a no-tension point-stress check, not a full tendon-zone or cracked-section decompression analysis. Milestone 4.6 adds `concrete_pmm_pro/verification/sls_benchmarks.py` for SLS sign and benchmark checks covering axial compression, biaxial bending sign, eccentric prestress sign, transformed section behavior, no-tension/decompression judgement, and governing SLS result selection; results can be exported as `sls_verification_results.csv`. Milestone 4.7 adds `concrete_pmm_pro/serviceability/cracking.py` for tension/cracking risk classification from existing SLS stress results, including tension-limit exceedance, no-tension violation, decompression violation, critical point filtering, and `sls_cracking_classification.csv` export. Milestone 4.8 adds `concrete_pmm_pro/serviceability/points.py` for custom SLS stress check point parsing, section/void validation, default/custom point merging, governing inclusion metadata, and `sls_stress_check_points.csv` export. Milestone 4.9 adds `concrete_pmm_pro/visualization/sls_stress.py` for selected-combo SLS section stress plots, stress point hover data, cracking/tension overlay fields, stress bar diagrams, and `sls_stress_visualization_selected_combo.csv` export. The current serviceability workflow does not perform full cracked-section stress redistribution, crack-width checks, unbonded prestress serviceability modeling, full unsymmetric `Ixy` stress coupling, full stress contours, or report export yet.

The PMM prototype uses this sign convention: compression force is positive, steel/prestress tension force is negative, x is positive to the right, y is positive upward, `Mnx = sum(F * (y - y_ref))`, and `Mny = sum(F * (x - x_ref))`. Section strain is positive in compression and negative in tension. Prestress initial strain is positive in tendon tension. Bonded prestress total tensile strain is modeled as `eps_ps,total = eps_pe - eps_section`, so compression strain at the tendon reduces tendon tensile strain and tension strain increases it. Prestressing steel stress is modeled as a tensile magnitude, then converted to tension-negative section force. Compression reversal of prestressing steel is future work. Demand naming remains separate: `Mux` and `Muy` are demand inputs, while `Mnx` and `Mny` are nominal resistance outputs.

PMM result display helpers convert internal `N` and `N-mm` values to `kN` and `kN-m` for review. The display dataframe includes `phiPn_capped_N`, `phiPn_capped_kN`, `prestress_force_N`, `prestress_force_kN`, prestress included/ignored counts, `rebar_displaced_concrete_subtracted_N`, `rebar_displaced_concrete_subtracted_kN`, and `rebar_inside_compression_count`. Ordinary rebar inside the Whitney compression block uses `As(fs - 0.85f'c)` when the Analysis Settings toggle is enabled, while prestressing steel still uses its separate prototype stress-strain path without displaced-concrete subtraction. The ULS D/C workflow now prefers a cleaned selected-Pu slice envelope built from interpolated theta-family PMM slice points, then estimates directional capacity by intersecting the demand moment ray with the actual Mx-My envelope boundary. If ray-intersection envelope capacity cannot be used, the workflow falls back to polar slice interpolation and point-cloud methods with warnings. Axial-only D/C uses capped maximum phiPn. D/C display tables and CSV export identify capacity method, slice method, envelope method, fallback state, and warning count. The PMM Slice Dashboard reuses the same prototype point cloud to show raw slice points, cleaned envelope boundary, demand vector, 3D PMM interaction view, PMM summary card, D/C ranking table, selected slice CSV export, and selected envelope CSV export. The PMM verification suite in `concrete_pmm_pro/verification/pmm_benchmarks.py` runs benchmark-style sanity checks on rectangular RC and RC + bonded PT Bar cases, including interpolated slice availability, envelope robustness, directional capacity checks, and displaced-concrete toggle comparisons. The independent hand-check suite in `concrete_pmm_pro/verification/hand_checks.py` compares selected solver behavior against simplified hand calculations for axial compression, rebar displaced concrete, prestress strain/stress conventions, uniaxial RC strain compatibility, and symmetry sanity; results can be exported as `pmm_hand_check_results.csv` from the Analysis tab. The SLS benchmark suite in `concrete_pmm_pro/verification/sls_benchmarks.py` verifies compression-negative/tension-positive stress signs, gross/transformed stress behavior, eccentric prestress sign, no-tension/decompression judgement, governing SLS selection, crack classification checks, and custom SLS stress point behavior; results can be exported as `sls_verification_results.csv`. Cracking classification uses existing SLS stress results only, supports `all` or `extreme_fibers_only` critical point filtering, and exports `sls_cracking_classification.csv`. Custom SLS stress check points can represent tendon zones, web-flange junctions, segmental joints, construction joints, reentrant corners, or general custom review points; invalid geometry is reported before analysis and governing inclusion can be disabled per point. SLS stress visualization plots selected-combo stress check points on the section outline with holes/voids, custom point metadata, status/classification marker colors, hover details, and an optional stress bar diagram; visualization data exports as `sls_stress_visualization_selected_combo.csv`. Directional moment D/C, warning summaries, numerical checks, benchmark checks, hand checks, SLS verification checks, cracking classification, custom SLS point checks, SLS stress visualization, and elastic SLS stress/no-tension/decompression checks remain prototype engineering review tools only; final production validation, unbonded prestress, report export, cracked-section stress redistribution, crack-width checks, full transformed/cracked serviceability refinements, and prestress loss/profile effects are future work.


## Solver validation direction

Concrete PMM Pro now includes a PMM solver validation framework and the first executable RC-only benchmark pack:

- `QA.VALIDATION1` — validation matrix / report structure
- `VALID.RC1` — rectangular RC PMM benchmark pack with axial-cap, uniaxial bending, symmetry, and numeric-schema checks

These validation assets are not a final certification. They are the project control system for reducing prototype warnings only when benchmark evidence supports the change.

### UI.VALIDATION.STATUS1 — Validation status panel

The Analysis workspace now includes a commercial-facing validation status panel.  It summarizes which PMM method areas have implemented benchmark coverage, which are still validation-in-progress, and which are planned future checks.  This replaces broad `Prototype Result` heading wording while retaining Diagnostics / QA notes for final engineering review.

### UI.VALIDATION.STATUS1.1 — Validation Evidence Detail Polish

The Analysis validation panel now separates the first-screen validation overview from the detailed evidence table.  The compact overview shows method area, validation status, design-use guidance, and case ID.  A nested detailed evidence expander keeps benchmark evidence and remaining engineering limitations available for QA without crowding the main Analysis result page.  This milestone does not change solver equations; it improves how validation evidence is communicated to users.

### UI.ANALYSIS3.9 — Result Hierarchy and Solver Info Cleanup

The Analysis diagnostics now use a cleaner commercial-style hierarchy. First-screen solver diagnostics show only compact QA essentials, while detailed PMM envelope metadata, reinforcement/prestress solver metadata, prestress stress-state diagnostics, and RC-only vs RC+PS capacity comparisons are retained in collapsed QA expanders. This is a UI hierarchy and traceability refinement only; it does not change solver equations or D/C results.

### UI.ANALYSIS4 — Governing PMM Slice Visualization

The PMM Check tab now emphasizes the governing Mux-Muy slice at the selected Pu.  The figure shows the cleaned PMM slice envelope, the demand vector, the capacity ray, and the ray/envelope intersection used to compute available phiMn and D/C.  Selected-case cards also show capacity margin and reserve ratio.  This milestone does not change PMM equations or D/C extraction; it makes the existing SOLVER.PMM.DC1 ray-intersection result traceable to the user visually.


- UI.ANALYSIS4.1: Clean PMM slice plot interaction with selected-only default, optional chart annotations, and controlled all-ULS demand point overlay.

### UI.ANALYSIS4.2 — Governing Slice Plot Minimal Mode

The PMM Check slice plot now uses a governing-case-only display by default and resets the annotation control key so old session-state callouts do not persist after upgrade.  Annotation callouts remain available for presentation screenshots, but they are off by default because text boxes can hide demand and capacity markers.  The plot can still show selected cases, selected + governing, or all active ULS points when the user explicitly chooses those modes.

### UI.ANALYSIS4.3 — Result Confidence / Design Decision Banner

Adds a first-screen design decision banner to the Analysis workspace. The banner separates the governing ULS PMM strength decision from QA diagnostics so users can distinguish direct governing-result warnings from background method notes. It summarizes PASS/FAIL, confidence, final review scope, D/C, fallback count, D/C warnings, governing QA count, and capacity margin without changing PMM solver equations or D/C extraction.

### UI.ANALYSIS4.4 — Final Analysis Workspace Polish

The Analysis workspace decision area now avoids duplicate status storytelling between the top workspace header and the Design Decision banner.  The header acts as a compact workspace status strip, while the decision banner carries the engineering conclusion.  The banner also separates Decision, Confidence, and Scope / Exclusions into dedicated blocks so ULS PMM strength status, validation confidence, prestress inclusion, and SLS exclusion are easier to read.  This milestone is UI communication polish only and does not change solver equations, PMM surface generation, demand/capacity extraction, prestress behavior, load import, report export, or cache behavior.

### SECTION.PRESET1A — Parametric I-Girder Geometry

Adds a bridge-oriented parametric I-Girder preset under the Girder category. The preset uses mm units and the following user-facing variables: B1, B2, D1, D2, D3, D5, D6, T1, T2, and C1. The generated geometry is a symmetric analysis-ready concrete polygon with validation checks for web/flange/haunch dimensions before downstream PMM or future girder analysis.

### UI.SECTION.PRESET1.1 — Simplified section preset selection

The Section Builder now uses a direct **Section Type / Preset** selector so parametric girder presets such as **Parametric I-Girder** are visible without first selecting a category. Geometry family/category is still shown as metadata and is available in an optional browse expander.

### SECTION.PRESET1A.1 — I-Girder Geometry Visual Polish & Dimension QA

Parametric I-Girder now includes an engineering-oriented dimension QA panel in Section Builder. The preset reports the depth stack, web clear zone, top/bottom web transition checks, optional C1 chamfer note, and analysis-compatibility status. Geometry metadata now records I-girder zone depths and ULS PMM / future SLS / future Beam-Girder compatibility tags.

### SECTION.PROP1 — Parametric Section Properties Calculation

- Added gross section property calculation for generated section polygons, including net area, centroid, centroidal Ix/Iy, extreme-fiber distances, and top/bottom section modulus.
- Parametric I-Girder section properties now display analysis-ready Ix/Iy instead of placeholder values.
- These properties provide the basis for future prestressed bridge girder SLS stress checks and station-based Beam/Girder workflows.


### SECTION.PRESET1B — Parametric Plank Girder Geometry

Adds bridge-oriented parametric plank girder presets for **Interior** and **Exterior** girders.  The generated concrete polygon is the precast plank only, using B, b1, b2, b3, H, h1, and h2 in mm.  Composite bridge-girder metadata is retained for future AASHTO workflows: Tslab, manual Be, Ebeam, Edeck, auto n = Edeck/Ebeam, auto Btransformed = n × Be, girder length, and exterior overhang where applicable.  Auto AASHTO effective flange width calculation is intentionally marked as planned; current Be is project/manual input with transformed-width values calculated automatically.

### SECTION.PRESET1B.2 — Plank Girder Stepped-Profile Geometry Hotfix

Corrects the parametric plank-girder concrete outline to follow the user-confirmed reference geometry.  Interior plank width is now generated as B at y = 0 and y = h1, b3 at y = h2, and B - 2*b1 at y = H with symmetric side recesses.  Exterior plank keeps the right exterior edge vertical for full depth; the left interior edge is at x = 0 for y = 0 to h1, x = b2 at y = h2, and x = b1 at y = H.  This is a geometry-shape hotfix only; composite metadata, section-property summary, PMM solver, analysis workspace, and report behavior are unchanged.


### UI.ACTIVE.TABS1
- Added deterministic app-owned active tab highlighting for Workspace, Setup/Sections subpages, Analysis subpages, and Column/Pier ULS checks.
- Active tab state is rendered from `st.session_state` instead of relying on Streamlit's version-dependent selected-state DOM.
- No solver, geometry, load, report, rebar, prestress, or project schema changes.


## UI.ACTION.BUTTONS1

- Highlight primary action buttons with a soft amber fill and bold dark-blue text.
- Apply the same action language to upload browse buttons.
- Mark PMM Run, Save Project, Load Project JSON, and project info update as primary actions.
- No solver, geometry, loads, rebar, prestress, report, or project schema changes.


## UI.SECTION.COMPACT1 — Section Builder compact working layout

- Reflowed Section Builder into a compact working layout: geometry inputs and gross properties now stack in the left column while live preview remains in the right column.
- Reduced preview canvas height and converted preview status into compact cards to remove the large unused left-side whitespace.
- Kept geometry generation, section-property calculations, PMM solver, reinforcement/prestress data, and project schema unchanged.


### UI.PRESTRESS.PREVIEW1 — Prestress preview visible by default
- Shows the Prestress page section preview directly when Prestress is enabled from Section Builder, including passive/reference prestress rows.
- Keeps ordinary rebar hidden from the default Prestress preview; combined rebar + prestress remains a collapsed coordination preview.
- Shows a geometry-only preview when Prestress is enabled but no active prestress rows are available yet.
- No prestress calculation, PMM, SLS, shear/torsion, report, or schema changes.

### UI.PMM.NAV4 — PMM Result View Tabs First + Remove SLS View Tab
- Move PMM result-view tabs immediately under the Flexural (PMM) result-view heading.
- Render decision/summary cards inside the Summary tab rather than above the tabs.
- Remove the local SLS tab from Flexural PMM result views; serviceability belongs in the main Analysis SLS subpage workflow.
- No solver, D/C, load, report, or project-schema changes.
